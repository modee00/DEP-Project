# DEP-Project
Consulting Project for the Department of Environmental Protection of NYC

This project has two aims. One allows the water department to look up the consumption for a specific meter,
and forecast consumption for that specific meter and the building(s) it serve(s).

The second aim allows the user to compare two building types side by side, study the average consumption for each,
and examine the forecasted consumption for each building type.
